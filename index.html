        <p id="disclaimer">Disclaimer: the story has some dark themes, like death. It is only in text, so there is no surprise graphic content.</p>
        <p>The Garden Gate is a choose-your-own-adventure story. It's not long, and you can, and should, 
            try to replay it a couple of times. Don't refresh the browser, just click replay-button when game ends. 
            Your goal is to get out from the garden, but to do that you need to find the reason you ended up there. 
            For this you need to find three story points. You can't miss them, I'll notify you when the point is found.</p>
        <p>Thank you for testing this game!</p>
