# The Garden Gate - Interactive story

## Strategy
This game is Choose your own adventure- type of story.  Player can choose to play only one story line or, if replayed, unlock the final story. This game is for fun, but has some darkes themes and is not suitable for young players. 

## Scope
Since the project can't be too large I choose to make a limited amount of story lines and make the game re-playable. To Make this sort of text-heavy game I have been advised to make use Of JSon, and will add most of the text on a separate file to be called on.

## Surface:
Style: 
I wanted this small game to have old school Nintendo gameboy feeling, 
mixed with "choose your own adventure"-type of text adventure mixed with gothic romance horror story.
The style would be visible in the background, and the "game screen" would be mostly white.
Some pictures that might appear during game are pixel art.

Colors: Black, white and gray tones. Nothing fancy here.

Fonts: Press Start 2P from Google Fonts
